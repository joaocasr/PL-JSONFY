# JSONfy

JSONfy is a tool that reads TOML input data and converts it to JSON format.
This tool was built with lex and yacc submodules from ply.
In each GIC semantic action, data structures such as dictionaries and lists were manipulated in order to produce the resulting JSON.

For more information go to TOML documentation: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

## How to use it

Add your TOML files in the Tests folder. While running the program, option 1) will allow the resulting JSON to be consumed by Json Server, which is a library that simulates a RESTFUL API. Therefore the input must be compatible with the data format that the Json Server can handle.
Option 2) will output the transformed data and will produce a JSON file.
1. Go to PL-JSONFY folder.
2. Write the following command on the terminal in the directory PL-JSONFY/ :
```
pyhon toml/UI.py
```

trimmed in raw strings.
   All other whitespace
   is preserved.
